# Philosophy

AI is a promising technology that has the potential to revolutionise many sectors such as healthcare, biometrics and industry. However, current security and privacy concerns prevent AI teams from accessing sensitive data to train and deploy their models. The current lack of toolings, providing technical guarantees, hinders AI adoption due to data ownersâ€™ fear of uncontrolled data usage.
That is why we have created Mithril Security, an open source solution, to help AI teams leverage sensitive data, while providing the technical guarantees to data owners and regulation that data shared to AI models remains protected at all time.
By leveraging Confidential Computing and existing AI solutions like ONNX or Pytorch, we make AI privacy easy for data teams.
