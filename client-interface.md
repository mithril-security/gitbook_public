# Client API

### **ModelDatumType**

An enumeration of the acceptable input data types. Used to specify the type of the input data of a model before uploading it to the server.

| Member | Type       |
| ------ | ---------- |
| F32    | float32    |
| F64    | float64    |
| I32    | int32      |
| I64    | int64      |
| U32    | unsigned32 |
| U64    | unsigned64 |

### **connect\_server (addr, certificate, policy, simulation)**

Estabilish a connection with BlindAI inference server and perform the process of requesting and verifying the attestation.

| Param       | Type   | description                                                                              |
| ----------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| addr        | `str`  | the address of BlindAI server                                                            |
| certificate | `str`  | path to the public key of the untrusted inference server. Generated in the server side.  |
| policy      | `str`  | path to the toml file describing the policy of the server. Generated in the server side. |
| simulation  | `bool` | connect to the server in the simulation mode (default `False`).                          |

The function won't return anything if the connection was successful. In case of an issue, appropriate exceptions will be raised:

| exception type    | description                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ValueError        | will be raised in case the policy doesn't match the server identity and configuration.      |
| VersionError      | Will be raised if the version of the server is not supported by the client.                 |  
| ConnectionError   | will be raised if the connection with the server fails.                                     |
| FileNotFoundError | will be raised if the policy file, or the certificate file is not found (in Hardware mode). |

### **upload\_model (model, shape) -> UploadModelResponse** 

Upload a pretrained model in ONNX format to BlindAI server.

| Param | Type             | description                                                 |

| dtype | `ModelDatumType` | the type of the model input data                            |
| sign  | `Boolean`        | get signed response from the server or not (default `True`) |

Returns a `UploadModelResponse` object with the follwing fields:

| ----- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| proof | `ProofData`      | proof of the execution, contains the signature and the payload returned by the server |
