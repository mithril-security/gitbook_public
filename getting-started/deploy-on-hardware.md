# Deploy on Hardware

## Hardware requirements

You will need to have an Intel SGX ready device (with `SGX+FLC` support). Please make sure to have the `SGX+FLC` drivers (preferably with the version **1.41**) installed on your system before running the docker image. [Please check this link to get more information about the drivers](https://github.com/intel/SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives/tree/master/driver/linux).

If you are using an Azure DCXS VM, the drivers are already installed.

{% hint style="success" %}
If the drivers are named "enclave" and "provision" (or sgx\_enclave and sgx\_provision), you are good to go!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the drivers are named "isgx", that means your system is not supported. This driver is for the first generation of SGX, which lacks security features we rely on.
{% endhint %}

Otherwise, here is a way to install the drivers quickly:

```
wget https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-linux/2.15.1/distro/ubuntu18.04-server/sgx_linux_x64_driver_1.41.bin
chmod +x sgx_linux_x64_driver_1.41.bin
./sgx_linux_x64_driver_1.41.bin
```

The binary file contains the drivers signed by Intel, and will proceed to the installation transparently.

## Running the server

Please make sure you have [Docker ](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)installed on your machine.

{% tab title="Generic (Azure DCs v2 / On premise / Other)" %}
A [Quote Provisioning Certificate Caching Service (PCCS)](https://github.com/intel/SGXDataCenterAttestationPrimitives/blob/master/QuoteGeneration/pccs/README.md) is built-in inside the Docker Image in order to generate the DCAP attestation from the enclave. You need to provide an API Key in order for the PCCS server to function. [You can get one from Intel here.](https://api.portal.trustedservices.intel.com/provisioning-certification)

```bash
docker run -it \
    -p 50051:50051 \
    -p 50052:50052 \
    --device /dev/sgx/enclave \
    --device /dev/sgx/provision \
    mithrilsecuritysas/blindai-server:latest /root/start.sh PCCS_API_KEY
```

The `PCCS_API_KEY` needs to be replaced with your PCCS API Key.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Azure DCs v3" %}
There is no need for a PCCS API Key, just run the following:

```bash
docker run -it \
    -v $(pwd)/bin/tls:/root/tls \
    -p 50051:50051 \
    -p 50052:50052 \
    --device /dev/sgx/enclave \
    --device /dev/sgx/provision \
    mithrilsecuritysas/blindai-server-dcsv3:latest
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Get the policy and TLS Certificate

In hardware mode, we are required to pass two files that were generated previously by the server to the client: `policy.toml` and `host_server.pem`. Read more about what these files are used for here: [certificate-and-policy.md](../advanced/certificate-and-policy.md "mention")

You may pull the policy for the latest prebuilt server binary with this command:

```
docker run --rm mithrilsecuritysas/blindai-server:latest cat /root/policy.toml > policy.toml
```

If you wish to use the default built-in TLS certificate, you need to pull the certificate first as well.

```
docker run --rm mithrilsecuritysas/blindai-server:latest cat /root/tls/host_server.pem > host_server.pem
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Please remember that this certificate is **not secure**, it is strongly recommended to [generate your own certificate](../advanced/certificate-and-policy.md#inject-your-own-tls-certificate-to-blindai).
{% endhint %}
